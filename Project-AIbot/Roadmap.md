# Technical Roadmap

## 1. Define Technical Specifications
- Clearly define technical specifications, including hardware and software requirements.

## 2. Hardware Setup
- Ensure all devices are on the same local network.
- Set up cameras and sensors on the toy car.
- Verify network connectivity and bandwidth.

## 3. Software Setup
- Install required software and libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) on each device.
- Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) for code management.

## 4. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- Implement a data acquisition system for collecting images and corresponding actions.
- Preprocess the dataset for training (resizing, cropping, normalization).

## 5. Model Architecture Design
- Design a behavioral cloning model architecture suitable for the toy car task.
- Choose a deep learning framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch) for model implementation.

## 6. Single-Machine Training
- Implement and train the initial model on a single machine using the collected dataset.
- Evaluate model performance and identify areas for improvement.

## 7. Model Optimization
- Optimize the model for deployment, considering size and inference speed.
- Explore techniques such as quantization, pruning, or model compression.

## 8. Distributed Training Preparation
- Modify the training script to support distributed training.
- Choose a distributed training strategy (e.g., MirroredStrategy in TensorFlow).

## 9. Network Configuration
- Configure the local network to ensure low-latency communication between devices.
- Verify that devices can communicate effectively during training.

## 10. Distributed Training
- Set up multiple devices to participate in distributed training.
- Run the distributed training script and monitor training progress.

## 11. Model Evaluation and Validation
- Evaluate the trained distributed model using a validation set.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## 12. Real-World Deployment
- Implement the trained model on the toy car platform.
- Conduct real-world testing in different scenarios.

## 13. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Implement monitoring tools for tracking model performance.
- Address any issues identified during real-world testing.
- Consider a mechanism for model updates and maintenance.

## 14. Documentation
- Document technical details, including hardware setup, software architecture, and configurations.
- Create clear documentation for model deployment and maintenance procedures.

## 15. Continuous Improvement
- Gather feedback and performance metrics for future model enhancements.
- Explore possibilities for adding new features or optimizing the model further.
