# Practical Use:

The goal of the research is to use behavioural cloning to create an autonomous toy automobile. This technology has immediate applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles.

# Practical Deep Learning Experience:

Specifically in the context of behavioural cloning, the research offers a hands-on chance to deploy and experiment with deep learning approaches.

# Challenges of Distributed Training:

Putting distributed training into practice presents new difficulties and complications, but it also presents a chance to get invaluable experience configuring and managing distributed systems.

# Multiple Camera Input:

The project becomes increasingly complicated due to the use of three camera inputs, which simulate a more realistic environment and need for efficient preprocessing and integration methods.

# Flexibility in Skill Set:

The project offers a full learning experience by integrating expertise in robotics, distributed systems, deep learning, and computer vision.

# Aspects of Scalability:

  Scalability is made possible by distributed training, allowing the model to be trained concurrently on several devicesâ€”a feature that may come in handy for future, larger-scale projects.

# Ethics and Safety:

  Since the research uses a toy automobile, it offers a chance to investigate safety issues and moral issues with autonomous systems in accordance with industry norms.
